>>> pls explain me 100s status codes in backend development in detail with proper technicalities but explanation in simple language
Hey there, let's talk about the wonderful world of HTTP status codes. These are special numbers that websites send
back to your browser when you make a request to access a resource on their server. There are five main categories
of these status codes: Informational, Successful, Redirection, Client Error, and Server Error.

1. **Informational Status Codes (100-199)**

These status codes give information about the server or the current state of the request. You won't usually see
these in everyday use but it's good to know they exist!

   * 100: Continue - The server is ready to receive data from you, so go ahead and send your request.
   * 101: Switching Protocols - The server wants to change protocols during communication (like switching from
HTTP to HTTPS).
   * 102: Processing - The server needs some time to process your request.

2. **Successful Status Codes (200-299)**

These are the success codes that let you know everything went well with your request! Yay!

   * 200: OK - Your request was successful, and the server will respond with a resource.
   * 201: Created - The server created a new resource for you based on your request.
   * 202: Accepted - The server has accepted your request but might not have fully processed it yet.
   * 203: Non-Authoritative Information - The server received information from another source that is not
authoritative (like, it's not the original data).
   * 204: No Content - The server will not return any content with this response.
   * 205: Reset Content - Similar to 204, but the browser might still send a request header.
   * 206: Partial Content - The server is returning only a part of the requested resource.

3. **Redirection Status Codes (300-399)**

These codes tell your browser where to find the resource you're looking for. So, follow these redirects!

   * 301: Moved Permanently - The requested resource has been permanently moved to another location.
   * 302: Found - The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
   * 303: See Other - Similar to 302 but the browser should use a GET request for the new location.
   * 304: Not Modified - You've already got the latest version of the requested resource, so there's no need to
fetch it again.
   * 305: Use Proxy - The server wants you to use a proxy to access the requested resource.
   * 307: Temporary Redirect - Similar to 302 but the browser should use the same method (like POST) for the new
location.

4. **Client Error Status Codes (400-499)**

These codes indicate that there's something wrong with your request, so you might need to make some changes!

   * 400: Bad Request - Your request contains invalid data or is missing required information.
   * 401: Unauthorized - You don't have the necessary credentials to access the requested resource (like, you
forgot your password!).
   * 403: Forbidden - The server won't allow your request because of security restrictions.
   * 404: Not Found - The requested resource doesn't exist on the server (like, a non-existent page).
   * 405: Method Not Allowed - You're trying to use an unsupported HTTP method (like, you used POST instead of GET).
   * 406: Not Acceptable - The server won't provide content in the format your browser can understand.
   * 407: Proxy Authentication Required - The proxy requires additional authentication information from you before accessing the resource.

5. **Server Error Status Codes (500-599)**

These codes indicate that something went wrong on the server, so don't worry, it's not just you!

   * 500: Internal Server Error - A general error that doesn't provide any specific details.
   * 501: Not Implemented - The server can't handle your request because of a missing implementation.
 * 502: Bad Gateway - An intermediate server between you and the final destination returned an error (like, a
proxy).
   * 503: Service Unavailable - The server is currently unavailable for maintenance or some other reason.
   * 504: Gateway Timeout - The gateway server didn't receive a response from the final destination within a
certain time limit.
   * 505: HTTP Version Not Supported - The server doesn't support the version of HTTP your browser is using (like,
old browsers with outdated versions).
   * 506: Variant Also Negotiable - This status code is for situations where the client can choose between
different representations of a resource.

Now that you know all about these HTTP status codes, you're well-equipped to handle any situation that might come
up in your web development journey. Enjoy your newfound knowledge and happy coding!
