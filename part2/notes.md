### when is middleware used ?

Whenever my browser sends a request to backend, it goes to it's route and if at backend I want to check something in that request or want to add something, in all those cases middleware is used.

### express session Vs cookie

- cookie hota hai browser par data save karne ke liye
- session hota hai server par data save karne ke liye
> ek down side (drawback) hai, ki agar server reset/restart hua to data saara erase ho jaayega.
